# CraigslistVehicleDataCleaning

This is a project carried over from university courses.

Originally the cleaning was done through Excel and visualizations were done through a student licence version of Tableau

This version is a reword of that same project but this time done through Python (and later R which is not featured here).
Using the tricks I learned in Tableau, I used Tableau Public to create a dynamic visualization that allows filtering the data by a few useful metrics.

The final Tableau Public visualization can be found here
