# Craigslist Vehicle Data Cleaning

### Data Source

The data was found on Kaggle.com at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data
I decided to use this data source as it is very large and allow plentyful explorationg and experimentation

### Origin of the Project

When taking a "Descriptive Analytics" course at Stetson University, I completed the first verison of this project.
The data was cleaned using Excel and visualizations were made with a student licence of Tableau

The project scope was the same and cleaning was done identically as seen here. The visualizations were not dynamic and were presented in class via PowerPoint.

### New Version

This version is a rework of that same project but this time done through Python (and later R which is not featured here).
Using the tricks I learned in class, I used Tableau Public to create a dynamic visualization that allows filtering the data by a few useful metrics.

The final Tableau Public visualization can be found here

### Python Cleaning

The cleaning is very simple and mostly removes bad faith, repeat, and incomplete listings.
